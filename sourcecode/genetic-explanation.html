            <h2 class="text-primary">Genetic Algorithms Explained</h2>
            <p class="text-break">Genetic algorithms (GAs for short) are algorithms designed to solve optimization problems. They are based on the theory of evolution and natural selection, in which generations of a species adapt and develop to fit their circumstances as much as possible. GAs find solutions with processes inspired by natural selection such as selection, crossover and mutation. The more generations a GA has undergone, the more likely that generation has the best possible solution to the problem it was given.</p>

            <h4 class="text-primary">Whatâ€™s the general process?</h4>
            <p class="text-break">
                GAs are heavily inspired by natural processes, so the terms are also based off of it. A GA starts with a population of a chosen amount of individuals with each having a set of randomly generated parameters, the first generation. After each individual has been evaluated on their parameters and received a fitness-score, breeding begins. The breeding process can vary from application to application, but in general the best fitting individuals are chosen to create children with each other. During the creation of a child, each parameter gets randomly selected from the parents, this is called crossover. After this process, each parameter has a chance to be slightly mutated, so that random variation can bring change. The breeding process is repeated until there is a new generation as big as the original one, and this process then keeps repeating itself. The more generations have passed, the more optimised the current generation and thus the solution is.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/process.jpg" alt="Process" class="rounded float-start me-3">
            <p class="text-break">
                GAs are used to optimise a process or to find the best possible solution to a problem. It has many uses and applications in a wide variety of fields (if not every field), such as medicine and pharmaceutics, engineering, robotics and finance to name a few. In engineering a new type of wing, for example, the ratio of lift to drag can be optimised by using a GA to predict the optimal parameters of the design (material used, measurements, etc.).

            <p class="text-break">
                50 individuals are created per generation. Each one gets the chance to play the game. The moves made by each gene get rated based on [INSERT PARAMETERS]. Once the individuals are done with their moves, they get sorted in a list in ascending order based on their respective rating. The ones with the best ratings are selected to create children for the next generation. [INSERT SPECIFIC TYPE OF SELECTION] There is also the possibility of a child mutating their genes [INSERT EXACT NUMBERS]. At the end of the cycle a new generation of 50 genes is created out of the best scoring ones from the previous generation, at which point the cycle can start again.
