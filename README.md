# team-4

This project will be a Tetris game playable by a user or AI (Artificial Intelligence) via a webbrowser.

The user can choose between playing the game himself/herself or letting the AI play for them. The AI uses a Genetic Algorithm (which is used in 
various medical sectors as well) to teach itself to play the game. The more it plays the game, the better it becomes.

The user can make the AI stop any time and continue playing the game themselves.

Currently the website is deployed on:
