The user can choose between playing the game themself, or they can let an AI play for them. The AI uses a genetic algorithm to learn which moves are best. The more it plays the game, the better it becomes. More info about genetic algorithms can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) or [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/genetic-algorithms/).
