This project will be a Tetris game playable by an user or AI (Artificial Intelligence) via de web.

The user can choose between playing the game himself/herself or letting the AI play for them. The AI uses Genetic Algorithm (which 
is used in various medical sectors aswell) to teach itself to play the game. The longer it plays the game, the better it becomes.

The user can anytime make the AI stop and continue playing the game themselves.
